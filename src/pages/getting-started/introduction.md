Welcome to the Postman docs! This is the place to find official information on how to use Postman in your API projects.

<img alt="Postman full view" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/intro-postman-request-selected-3-v10.jpg" width="1100px"/>

If you're starting to learn about APIs and Postman, you can use a variety of channels both in and outside Postman:

* [__Send your first request!__](/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/)
* Use the Bootcamp to work through lessons inside Postman. Open it by selecting <img alt="Bootcamp icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-bootcamp-v9.jpg#icon" width="16px"> **Bootcamp** from the Postman footer.
* Explore [workspaces, collections, and more](https://www.postman.com/explore) that you can try out inside Postman, like the following:
    * [**Learn by API**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/published-postman-templates/collection/9065401-ff29b3be-af69-4442-91e0-c1158b620fc2?ctx=documentation): Explore beginner API concepts.
    * [**Postman Training**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-galaxy-training/overview): Learn APIs 101, Testing and Automation, API Adoption, and API First, earning [Postman badges](https://badgr.com/public/issuers/BC0x4AQaQPC7lFilsBP_tQ/badges).
    * [**Student Program**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-student-program/overview): Take the Student Expert training, covering request configurations and test scripting.

## What are you here to learn about?

If you're learning to carry out a specific task or workflow in Postman, check out the following topics to find resources:

* [__Making requests__](#making-requests)
* [__Testing APIs__](#testing-apis)
* [__Building and managing APIs__](#building-and-managing-apis)
* [__Publishing APIs__](#publishing-apis)
* [__Collaborating with your team__](#collaborating-with-your-team)
* [__Developing with Postman__](#developing-with-postman)
* [__Postman Flows__](#postman-flows)

### Making requests

If you're building a client app or want to connect to an API, check out some Postman essentials:

* [Connecting to APIs](/docs/sending-requests/requests/)
* [Authorizing requests](/docs/sending-requests/authorization/)
* [Grouping requests in collections](/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/)
* [Using variables](/docs/sending-requests/variables/)
* [Visualizing data](/docs/sending-requests/visualizer/)

### Testing APIs

If you're testing an API, you can use Postman to automate various parts of the process:

* [Writing test scripts](/docs/writing-scripts/test-scripts/)
* [Automating workflows with the collection runner](/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/)
* [Capturing HTTP requests](/docs/sending-requests/capturing-request-data/capturing-http-requests/)
* [Test script examples](/docs/writing-scripts/script-references/test-examples/)

### Building and managing APIs

If you're developing a back-end, working API-first, or need to monitor API performance, Postman utilities can streamline your workflows:

* [Defining an API from a schema](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/the-api-workflow/)
* [Monitoring test runs](/docs/monitoring-your-api/intro-monitors/)
* [Analyzing API performance](/docs/reports/reports-overview/)
* [Mocking responses](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/)

### Publishing APIs

If you're exposing an API for public use, Postman can support developer onboarding:

* [Publishing documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/documenting-your-api/)
* [Using Run in Postman](/docs/publishing-your-api/run-in-postman/introduction-run-button/)

### Creating API workflows

If you're creating an API workflow, you can use Postman Flows:

* [Building your first flow](/docs/postman-flows/flows-intro/building-your-first-flow/)
* [About blocks](/docs/postman-flows/core-concepts/blocks/)

### Collaborating with your team

* [Managing Postman for an organization](/docs/administration/managing-your-team/managing-your-team/)
* [Onboarding your team](/docs/administration/onboarding-checklist/)
